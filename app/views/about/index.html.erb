This website provides access to geospatial data and scanned maps from our own collections,
as well as the collections of other institutions, in the service of our students, researchers,
and the global community. Patrons may easily search for content in a variety of ways, including
a user-friendly geographic spatial search, to find relevant data on a particular location on earth.
Much of the content is freely available, but some maps and datasets are restricted to Princeton
University-affiliated patrons or on-site use.

<h3>Scanned Maps and Georeferenced Maps</h3>
<p>
Scanned Maps are print maps that have been digitized. Many of these maps are
historic, allowing researchers to compare past geographic boundaries and names with their
modern counterparts. Princeton University Library has a strong commitment to scanning our
print maps collection, so scanned maps are added to the portal on a regular basis.
Georeferenced maps are scanned maps that contain coordinate reference system information which allows for
them to be superimposed on any georeferenced maps or geospatial data. Both Scanned Maps and
Georeferenced Maps are discoverable through the site's spatial search feature.

<h3>Sanborn Maps</h3>

<p>
  The Sanborn Map Company, founded in 1867, created detailed building maps of cities
  and towns all across the country, primarily for use by the insurance industry.
  These maps also have been used extensively by local government agencies for over
  a century in conducting their daily operations efficiently. As a result of its history,
  the name "Sanborn" has become synonymous with this kind of map. Genealogists, local history buffs,
  city planners, architects, and countless others have been drawn to the quality of detail found in them.
  Princeton University Library holds the entire collection of the companyâ€™s New Jersey volumes,
  which are made available on this website.

<h3>Vector Data</h3>
<p>
Vector Data is one model of GIS data where geospatial data is represented in three different geometry
types such as points, lines, and polygons and all the attribute values associated with the data are linked
to each geometry. For example, locations of bus stops, schools, and other points of interest could be
represented by points, road networks and rivers could be represented by lines, and property, country,
city, and census boundaries could be represented by polygons.

</div>

<h3>Raster Data</h3>
<p>
Raster is another model of GIS data where geospatial data is represented as a
matrix of cells and each contains an attribute value. Satellite image, elevation,
land cover data, etc. are usually stored in raster data format. The spatial
resolution of data depends on pixel/cell size. Higher resolution raster data has
smaller pixels and a larger file size.</p>
