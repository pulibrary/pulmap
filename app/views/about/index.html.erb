  In this Portal, we publish our scanned maps and most of our geospatial data. The site will allow
researchers to discover data published on our Portal. If the scanned maps and geospatial data are in the
public domain, users can view and download them. However, copyrighted scanned maps are not
accessible online they can be viewed only at the library. Furthermore, the licensed geospatial data is
accessible only to people who have Princeton University NetIDs. The Portal allows researchers to search
digital maps and geospatial data by using keyword, title, publisher/creator, and subject, but they can
also use map (spatial search) to find the data on a particular location on earth.

<h3>Scanned Maps</h3>
<p>
Scanned Maps are print maps that have been digitized and combined with geographic information, allowing for accurate positioning of the map on an interactive, modern globe. Many of the Scanned Maps available in the Digital Map and Geospatial Data Portal are historic, allowing researchers to compare past geographic boundaries and names with their modern counterparts. Princeton University Library has a strong commitment to scanning our print maps collection, so scanned maps are added to the portal on a regular basis.

<h3>Sanborn Maps</h3>

<p>Sanborn Maps are some of the most popular resources in our collection of Scanned Maps.
  The Sanborn Map Company is the oldest mapping company in the United States.
  Founded in 1866, the company created detailed building maps of cities and towns
  all across the country, primarily for use by insurance companies. These maps
  also have been used extensively by local government agencies for over a century
  in conducting their daily operations efficiently. Approximately 12,000 American
  cities and towns are chronicled in the company's collection of over one million maps.
  As a result of its history, the name "Sanborn" has become synonymous with this kind of map.
  Genealogists, local history buffs, city planners, architects, and countless others have
  been drawn to the quality of detail found in them. </p>

<h3>Vector Data</h3>
<p>
Vector Data is one model of GIS data where geospatial data is represented in three different geometry
types such as points, lines, and polygons and all the attribute values associated with the data are linked
to each geometry. For example, locations of bus stops, schools, and other points of interest could be
represented by points, road networks and rivers could be represented by lines, and property, country,
city, and census boundaries could be represented by polygons.

<h3>Raster Data</h3>
<p>
Raster is another model of GIS data where geospatial data is represented as a
matrix of cells and each contains an attribute value. Satellite image, elevation,
land cover data, etc. are usually stored in raster data format. The spatial
resolution of data depends on pixel/cell size. Higher resolution raster data has
smaller pixels and a larger file size.</p>
